    ## Description

    This entity contains a harmonised description of a Building. This entity is
    associated with the vertical segments of smart homes, smart cities, industry and
    related IoT applications.
    
    This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile
    operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/), compared to
    GSMA data model following changes are introduced:
    
    -   the reference to `BuildingType` is removed, since `BuildingType` compared to
        `category` attribute does not introduce significant information.
    
    -   `category` attribute is required.
    
    -   `openingHours` is introduced following schema.org data model to allow
        fine-grained on building opening times. GSMA supported this as free text in
        the `notes` attribute (removed as well).
    
    -   `refSubscriptionService` is not supported, since `SubscriptionService` model
        is not supported currently.
