This is a simple Node.js express application which offers an NGSI proxy interface to four context providers.

# NGSI-LD `/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/` Endpoints

Supported NGSI-LD context provider endpoints

-   `/random/temperature/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/random/relativeHumidity/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/random/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/random/weatherConditions/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/static/temperature/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/static/relativeHumidity/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/static/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/static/weatherConditions/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/catfacts/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/twitter/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/weather/temperature/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/weather/relativeHumidity/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`
-   `/weather/weatherConditions/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/`

The following dynamic NGSI-LD endpoints are supported

-   `/random/<type>/<mapping>/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id`. returns random data values of `"type": "<type>"` - e.g.
    `/random/text/quote/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id` will return random lorem ipsum

-   `/static/<type>/<mapping>/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id` returns static data values of `"type": "<type>"` - e.g.
    `/static/text/quote/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id` will return "I never could get the hang of thursdays"

-   `/twitter/<type>/<mapping><queryString>/<attr>/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id` Work in progress

-   `/weather/<type>/<mapping>/<queryString>/<attr>/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id` Retrieves the Weather data for the
    `queryString` location and maps the data from the given `attr` to the entity response.

    For Example `/weather/number/berlin%2cde/wind_speed/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id` will read the `wind_speed` value from
    Berlin. and `/weather/number/cairo%2ceg/temp/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/:id` will read the `temp` value from Cairo.

## Mappings

NGSI attribute names should follow Data Model Guidelines (e.g. `camelCasing`) Data returned from third-party APIs will
not enforce the same guidelines. It is therefore necessary to invoke a mapping to be able to know which values to
retieve.

The mapping path element is assumes that mappings are defined in the path as follows:

-   `temperature`
    -   `temperature` NGSI attribute maps to `temperature` attribute on the API data
-   `temperature:temp`
    -   `temperature` NGSI attribute maps to `temp` attribute on the API data
-   `temperature:temp,windSpeed:wind_speed`
    -   `temperature` NGSI attribute maps to `temp` attribute on the API data
    -   `windSpeed` NGSI attribute maps to `wind_speed` attribute on the API data

For the full guidelines see the
[FIWARE Data Models](https://fiware-datamodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guidelines/index.html)

## Health Check Endpoints

The following health check endpoints are supported:

-   `/random/health` A non-error response shows that an NGSI proxy is available on the network and returning values.
    Each Request will return some random dummy data.

-   `/static/health` A non-error response shows that an NGSI proxy is available on the network and returning values.
    Each Request will return the same data.

-   `/catfacts/health` A non-error response shows that an NGSI proxy is available on the network and returning values.
    Each Request will return the same data.

-   `/twitter/health` A non-error response shows that an NGSI proxy for the Twitter API is available on the network and
    returning values.

    If the proxy is correctly configured to connect to the Twitter API, a series of Tweets will be returned.

    The Twitter API uses OAuth2:

    -   To get Consumer Key & Consumer Secret for the Twitter API, you have to create an app in Twitter via
        [https://developer.twitter.com/](https://developer.twitter.com/). Then you'll be taken to a page containing
        Consumer Key & Consumer Secret.
    -   For more information see: [https://developer.twitter.com/](https://developer.twitter.com/)

-   `/weather/health` A non-error response shows that an NGSI proxy for the Weather API is available on the network and
    returning values.

    If the proxy is correctly configured to connect to the Open Weather Map API, the current weather in Berlin will be
    returned.

    Most of the Weather API features require an API key.

    -   Sign up for a key at [`https://openweathermap.org/api`](https://openweathermap.org/api)
    -   For more information see: [`https://openweathermap.org/appid`](https://openweathermap.org/appid)

## Keys and Secrets

All Keys and Secrets must be passed in using Environment variables. The following variables **must** be provided

-   `OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY_ID=<ADD_YOUR_KEY_ID>`
-   `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=<ADD_YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>`
-   `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=<ADD_YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>`
