**Description:**: This tutorial introduces the **NGSI-LD** Merge Patch endpoint. It explains the difference between
Merge **PATCH** (`/entities/<id>`) and Partial Update **PATCH** (`/entities/<id>/attrs`) and demonstrates the use of
this functionality.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Merge-Patch-Put/ngsi-ld.html)

The Merge Patch is a well defined [IETF specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396.html) used to describe a
set of modifications to be made on a resource. It uses a JSON payload as a forensic knife to create, modify or delete
individually specified attributes within an entity. As defined across the Internet, Merge Patch typically uses JSON
payloads, and is an action usually assigned to the HTTP **PATCH** method. NGSI-LD extends the concept for use with
JSON-LD payloads instead.

## Why two kinds of **PATCH** ?

### Partial Update **PATCH**

Partial Update Patch is supported under two endpoints - `/entities/<id>/attrs` and `/entities/<id>/attrs/<attr-name>`.
The rules of Partial Update **PATCH** is effectively an overwrite at the attribute level.

Given the following NGSI-LD _Property_:

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 25,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T01:59:26.535Z"
    }
}
```

And applying a Partial Update **PATCH** operation `/entities/<id>/attrs/temperature` with the following payload

```json
{
    "type": "Property",
    "value": 100,
    "observedAt": "2022-03-14T13:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Result 1

Results in an overwrite of the `value`and `observedAt` sub-Attributes, leaving the `unitCode` sub-Attribute untouched as
shown:

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 100,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T13:00:00.000Z"
    }
}
```

However given the same entity and applying a Partial Update **PATCH** operation at the `/entities/<id>/attrs` level

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 100,
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T13:00:00.000Z"
    }
}
```

#### Result 2

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 100,
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T13:00:00.000Z"
    }
}
```

Results in an overwrite of the whole `temperature` property. Note that in the second case `unitCode` has been removed as
well.

The idea of Partial Update **PATCH** at an attribute level is to aim for data consistency. If a sub-attribute such as
`observedAt` is omitted, then it is **not** removed and the existing value remains. A user is forced to deliberately
delete such data using other means.

The idea of Partial Update **PATCH** at an Entity level is to aim for temporal consistency. It is necessary to resupply
all of the sub-attributes within the first attribute layer for each update. If a sub-attribute such as `observedAt` is
omitted, then it is removed and the existing temporal record is not affected.

**PATCH** is appropriate for both of these operation since the effect in both cases is an update of some (but not all)
aspects of a selection of _Properties_ or _Properties of Properties_, the entity itself, its `id` and `type` remain
unchanged.

### Merge **PATCH**

Merge **PATCH** is supported under `/entities/<id>` and just upserts the attributes found in a payload. Again starting
from the following NGSI-LD _Property_:

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 25,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T01:59:26.535Z"
    }
}
```

Applying a merge **PATCH** operation `/entities/<id>` with the following payload

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 100,
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T13:00:00.000Z"
    }
}
```

Results in the update of the just the `value` and `observedAt` sub-Attributes as shown

#### Result 3

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 100,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T13:00:00.000Z"
    }
}
```

The idea of Merge **PATCH** at an Entity level is to correct existing data without regard for temporal consistency It is
not necessary to resupply unchanged sub-attributes. If a sub-attribute such as `observedAt` is omitted, then it is left
changed. If not careful, this may give rise to unexpected side-effects on the temporal interface since it is possible to
inadvertently update a `value` without updating the `observedAt`. is not affected.

In summary, both styles of **PATCH** operation have their place, but Merge **PATCH** is more focussed and is capable of
using smaller payloads. Partial Update **PATCH** forces data to be more consistent through requiring the payload to be
complete and removing second-level attributes which are omitted from the payload. This is also the case for the
`/entityOperations/upsert` endpoint meaning that second-level _Property-of-a-Property_ metadata attributes must always
be include in the payload if they do not want to be deleted. Therefore _Properties_ within `/entityOperations/upsert`
payload will usually also include `unitCode` and `observedAt` as well as an updated `value`.

### Overwrite **PUT**

HTTO **PUT** is supported under `/entities/<id>` and just overwrites the data within an existing entity. In this case
whole entity is overwritten, a payload such as the one below would result in an entity with a single `temperature`
attribute.

```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 25,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T01:59:26.535Z"
    }
}
```

**PUT** is guaranteed to be an idemponent operation. Calling it several times will result in the same system state,
whereas **PATCH** not necessarily idemponent, and a **PATCH** payload of either flavor (merge patch or partial update
patch), does not need supply every attribute from the entire entity data each time.

## Architecture

The required architecture will consist of three elements:

-   The [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json)
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the Orion Context Broker to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations
-   An HTTP **Web-Server** which offers static `@context` files defining the context entities within the system.

Since all interactions between the three elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the elements can be containerized and
run from exposed ports.

The necessary configuration information can be seen in the services section of the associated `docker-compose.yml` file.
It has been described in a previous tutorial.

Click on the image above to watch a demo of this tutorial describing how to use the NGSI-LD Merge Patch

## Start Up

Before you start, you should ensure that you have obtained or built the necessary Docker images locally. Please clone
the repository and create the necessary images by running the commands as shown:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Merge-Patch-Put.git
cd tutorials.Merge-Patch-Put
git checkout NGSI-LD

./services create
```

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Merge-Patch-Put/blob/NGSI-LD/services) Bash script provided within the
repository:

```bash
./services [orion|scorpio|stellio]
```

This start-up script also preloads two City entities into the context broker.

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

---

## Preflight

The Orion context broker supports the **OPTIONS** method to enable users to request the supported operations. The two
types of **PATCH** operation can be distinguished by reading the `Accept-Patch` header.

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -iX OPTIONS \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/'
```

#### Response:

The `/entities/` endpoint supports **GET** and **POST** operations only.

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 09:36:42 GMT
Allow: GET,POST,OPTIONS
Content-Length: 0
```

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -iX OPTIONS \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001'
```

#### Response:

The `/entities/<entity-id>` endpoint supports **GET**,**PUT**,**DELETE** and **PATCH** operations only. Because
**PATCH** is supported an additional `Accept-Patch` header is returned listing the appropriate payload types. It can be
noted that this list includes `application/merge-patch+json` since `/entities/<entity-id>` is a merge patch endpoint

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 09:49:43 GMT
Accept-Patch: application/json, application/ld+json, application/merge-patch+json
Allow: GET,PUT,DELETE,PATCH,OPTIONS
Content-Length: 0
```

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -iX OPTIONS \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001/attrs'
```

#### Response:

`/entities/<entity-id>/attrs/temperature` endpoint supports **POST** and **PATCH** operations only. The additional
`Accept-Patch` header does not include `application/merge-patch+json` since `/entities/<entity-id>/attrs` is a partial
update patch endpoint

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 09:49:27 GMT
Accept-Patch: application/json, application/ld+json
Allow: POST,PATCH,OPTIONS
Content-Length: 0
```

#### 4 Request:

```bash
curl -iX OPTIONS \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001/attrs/temperature'
```

#### Response:

`/entities/<entity-id>/attrs/<attr>` endpoint supports **DELETE** and **PATCH** methods only. The additional
`Accept-Patch` header does not include `application/merge-patch+json` since `/entities/<entity-id>/attrs/<attribute>` is
a partial update patch endpoint

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 09:49:10 GMT
Accept-Patch: application/json, application/ld+json
Allow: DELETE,PATCH,OPTIONS
Content-Length:
```

## Merge Patch Operations

Note that two preexisting entities have been created for amendment by Merge Patch, the current state of the entities can
be obtained by making a **GET** request to the `/entities/<entity-id>` endpoint. These requests can be made to see how
the entities have changed after each operation.

#### 5 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Updating using Merge Patch

This example moves the city `location` to 52.5146 N,13.350 E and amends the `temperature` to 20. The data here is in
normalized format, but concise format is also supported:

#### 7A Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \

    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            13.3505,
            52.5146
        ]
    }
}'
```

#### 8 Request:

Re-retrieving the `urn:ngsi-ld:City:001`, you can see that the `location` and `temperature` have changed, but all other
_Properties_ and _Properties of Properties_ such as `unitCode` ands `observedAt` remain unchanged:

```bash
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:City:001",
    "type": "City",
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",

        "object": "urn:ngsi-ld:Adminstration:Cumhuriyet_Halk_Partisi"
    }
}
```

### Adding new attributes using Merge Patch

For a merge patch operation, if an attribute is included in the payload but missing on the entity, it is inserted. In
this example, the `temperature` attribute is being updated, the `value` and `observedAt` have been updated, but the
`precision` _Property of a Property_ is being inserted.

As usual, both normalized and concise formats are supported.The default for unknown attributes is _Property_, to insert
a concise _Relationship_ or a _LanguageProperty_ include `object` or `languageMap` as expected.

#### 9A Normalized Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 7,
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T12:51:02.000Z",
        "precision": {
            "value": 0.95,
            "type": "Property",
            "unitCode": "C62"
        }
    }
}'
```

#### 9B Concise Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "temperature": {
        "value": 7,
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T12:51:02.000Z",
        "precision": {
            "value": 0.95,
            "unitCode": "C62"
        }
    }
}'
```

#### 10 Request:

Re-retrieving the `urn:ngsi-ld:City:001`, you can see that the `temperature` have changed, and the new `precision`
_Property of a Property_ has been inserted.

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'attrs=temperature' \
```

#### Response:

```json

    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:City:001",
    "type": "City",
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 7,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-03-14T12:51:02.000Z",
        "precision": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": 0.95,
            "unitCode": "C62"
        }
    }
}
```

### Removing existing attributes using Merge Patch

Usually `null` is used in merge patch operations to indicate deletion. However, JSON-LD does not support this (since an
attribute with a `null` is always removed from the payload on expansion) and therefore NGSI-LD uses a placeholder value
`urn:ngsi-ld:null` instead. Note that `urn:ngsi-ld:null` is equally valid for deletion of a _Property_, _Relationship_
or a _LanguageProperty_. In the concise example below, an insertion, an update and a deletion can be applied
simultaneously.

#### 11 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:002' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \

        }
    },
    "temperature": "urn:ngsi-ld:null"
}'

```

#### 12 Request:

Re-retrieving the `urn:ngsi-ld:City:002`, you can see that the `temperature` has been removed and the new `humidity`
_Property_ has been inserted and the `name` updated.

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:002' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \

### Amending values of a Property with sub-attributes

#### 14 Request:

Using concise format, it is necessary to distinguish between atttibutes of a JSON object and _Properties of Properties_.
In this case the use of `value` shows it is the `addressLocality` and `postalCode` of the `address` Object which is to
be updated and that `verified` the _Property of a Property_ is a metadata attribute.

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "address": {
        "value": {
            "addressLocality": "Fenerbahçe",
            "postalCode": "34567"
        },
        "verified": "true"
    }
}'
```

#### 15 Request:

Once again retrieving the `urn:ngsi-ld:City:001`, you can see that the `address` and its properties have been updated.

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'attrs=address' \
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:City:001",
    "type": "City",
    "address": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Kanlıca İskele Meydanı",
            "addressRegion": "İstanbul",
            "addressLocality": "Fenerbahçe",
            "postalCode": "34567"
        },
        "verified": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": "true"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Updating using key-values format

Merge Patch also offers some limited support to update `values` using key-values format. In this case any existing
`value` is updated, but no metadata is changed. Once again Object values need only send the sub-attributes to be
updated, and setting a sub-attribute to `urn:ngsi-ld:null` will cause it to be deleted.

This means that it is possible to **GET** a key-values entity, amend the values and **PATCH** it back to the context
broker.

#### 16 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "temperature": 19,
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            13.3505,
            52.5146
        ]
    },
    "address": {
        "addressLocality": "Beyoğlu",
        "postalCode": "98765"
    },
    "runBy": "urn:ngsi-ld:Adminstration:Adalet_ve_Kalkınma_Partisi"
}'
```

#### 17 Request:

Once again retrieving the `urn:ngsi-ld:City:001` entity, you can see that the attributes have been updated. It should be
noted that the _Relationship_ `runBy` is still defined as a _Relationship_, it is only the `object` value that has been
changed.

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'attrs=address,temperature,location,runBy' \
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:City:001",
    "type": "City",
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 19,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-06-30T00:00:00.000Z"
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [13.3505, 52.5146]
        }
    },
    "address": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Kanlıca İskele Meydanı",
            "addressRegion": "İstanbul",
            "addressLocality": "Beyoğlu",
            "postalCode": "98765"
        }
    },
    "runBy": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "object": "urn:ngsi-ld:Adminstration:Adalet_ve_Kalkınma_Partisi"
    }
}
```

### Updating using key-values with `observedAt`

Since `observedAt` is exceedingly important for maintaining consistent temporal data within the context broker it is
offered as an additional parameter when updating key-values during merge patch. If a pre-existing _Property_ already
uses `observedAt` _Property of a Property of a Property_, the timestamp will also be updated.

The following example updates both the location and temperature attributes

#### 18 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-d 'observedAt=2022-10-10T10:10:00.000Z' \
--data-raw '{
    "temperature": 19,
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            13.3505,
            52.5146
        ]
    }
}'
```

Once again retrieving the `urn:ngsi-ld:City:001` entity, you can see that the attributes have been updated, and this
time the timestamp has also changed.

#### 19 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'attrs=temperature,location' \
```

#### Response:

Note that `observedAt` is only ever updated. It is not added to a _Property_ where it was not present previously.

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:City:001",
    "type": "City",
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 19,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-10-10T10:10:00.000Z"
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [13.3505, 52.5146]
        }
    }
}
```

### Updating using key-values with `lang`

When retrieving an entity using **GET**, the `lang` parameter switches the attribute type from a `languageMap` to a
single string or string array. This is obviously a lossy operation, and in order for key-values merge patch fully
support entities with LanguageProperties, it is necessary to be able to merge a simple string value back into a
`languageMap`.

#### 20 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-d 'lang=en'
--data-raw '{
    "temperature": 19,
    "population": 15850000,
    "name": "Istanbul, not Constantinople"
}'
```

#### 21 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:City:001' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-d 'attrs=temperature,population,name'
```

#### Response:

As can be seen, `name` attribute in English (`en`) has been updated, whereas the values in Greek (`el`) and Turkish
(`tr`) have been left untouched.

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:City:001",
    "type": "City",
    "temperature": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 19,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2022-10-10T10:10:00.000Z"
    },
    "population": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": 15850000,
        "observedAt": "2022-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"
    },
    "name": {
        "type": "LanguageProperty",
        "languageMap": {
            "el": "Κωνσταντινούπολις",
            "en": "Istanbul, not Constantinople",
            "tr": "İstanbul"
        }
    }
}
```

### Overwriting an entity with **PUT**

For an overwrite operation, if an existing attribute is not included in the payload entity, it is deleted. In this
example, the `temperature`, `population` and `name` are being updated, any other attributes on the entity will be
deleted.

As usual, both normalized and concise formats are supported.
