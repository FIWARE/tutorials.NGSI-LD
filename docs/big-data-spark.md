**Description:** This tutorial is an introduction to the
[FIWARE Cosmos Orion Spark Connector](http://fiware-cosmos-spark.rtfd.io), which enables easier Big Data analysis over
context, integrated with one of the most popular BigData platforms: [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Apache
Spark is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data
streams. Spark has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and
at any scale.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Big-Data-Spark/ngsi-ld.html).

# Real-time Processing and Big Data Analysis

> "You have to find what sparks a light in you so that you in your own way can illuminate the world."
>
> — Oprah Winfrey

Smart solutions based on FIWARE are architecturally designed around microservices. They are therefore are designed to
scale-up from simple applications (such as the Supermarket tutorial) through to city-wide installations base on a large
array of IoT sensors and other context data providers.

The massive amount of data involved eventually becomes too much for a single machine to analyse, process and store, and
therefore the work must be delegated to additional distributed services. These distributed systems form the basis of
so-called **Big Data Analysis**. The distribution of tasks allows developers to be able to extract insights from huge
data sets which would be too complex to be dealt with using traditional methods. and uncover hidden patterns and
correlations.

As we have seen, context data is core to any Smart Solution, and the Context Broker is able to monitor changes of state
and raise [subscription events](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Subscriptions) as the context changes. For smaller
installations, each subscription event can be processed one-by-one by a single receiving endpoint, however as the system
grows, another technique will be required to avoid overwhelming the listener, potentially blocking resources and missing
updates.

**Apache Spark** is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. It provides an interface for
programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. The **Cosmos Spark** connector allows
developers write custom business logic to listen for context data subscription events and then process the flow of the
context data. Spark is able to delegate these actions to other workers where they will be acted upon either in
sequentially or in parallel as required. The data flow processing itself can be arbitrarily complex.

Obviously, in reality, our existing Supermarket scenario is far too small to require the use of a Big Data solution, but
will serve as a basis for demonstrating the type of real-time processing which may be required in a larger solution
which is processing a continuous stream of context-data events.

## Architecture

This application builds on the components and dummy IoT devices created in
[previous tutorials](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Agent/). It will make use of three FIWARE components - the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the
[IoT Agent for Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the
[Cosmos Orion Spark Connector](https://fiware-cosmos-spark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for connecting Orion to an
[Apache Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html). The Spark cluster itself will
consist of a single **Cluster Manager** _master_ to coordinate execution and some **Worker Nodes** _worker_ to execute
the tasks.

Both the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to
keep persistence of the information they hold. We will also be using the dummy IoT devices created in the
[previous tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Agent/).

Therefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   Two **FIWARE Generic Enablers** as independent microservices:
    -   The [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
        [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json).
    -   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will
        receive southbound requests using
        [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json)
        and convert them to
        [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        commands for the devices.
-   An [Apache Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html) consisting of a single
    **ClusterManager** and **Worker Nodes**:
    -   The FIWARE [Cosmos Orion Spark Connector](https://fiware-cosmos-spark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will be
        deployed as part of the dataflow which will subscribe to context changes and make operations on them in
        real-time.
-   One [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) **database**:
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations.
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys.
-   An HTTP **Web-Server** which offers static `@context` files defining the context entities within the system.
-   The **Tutorial Application** does the following:
    -   Acts as set of dummy [agricultural IoT devices](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Sensors/tree/NGSI-LD)
        using the
        [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual).

The overall architecture can be seen below:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Big-Data-Spark/img/Tutorial%20FIWARE%20Spark.png)

<h3>Spark Cluster Configuration</h3>

```yaml
spark-master:
    image: bde2020/spark-master:2.4.5-hadoop2.7
    container_name: spark-master
    expose:
        - "8080"
        - "9001"
    ports:
        - "8080:8080"
        - "7077:7077"
        - "9001:9001"
    environment:
        - INIT_DAEMON_STEP=setup_spark
        - "constraint:node==spark-master"
```

```yaml
spark-worker-1:
    image: bde2020/spark-worker:2.4.5-hadoop2.7
    container_name: spark-worker-1
    depends_on:
        - spark-master
    ports:
        - "8081:8081"
    environment:
        - "SPARK_MASTER=spark://spark-master:7077"
        - "constraint:node==spark-master"
```

The `spark-master` container is listening on three ports:

-   Port `8080` is exposed so we can see the web frontend of the Apache Spark-Master Dashboard.
-   Port `7070` is used for internal communications.

The `spark-worker-1` container is listening on one port:

-   Port `9001` is exposed, therefore that the installation can receive context data subscriptions.
-   Ports `8081` is exposed, therefore we can see the web frontend of the Apache Spark-Worker-1 Dashboard.

## Start Up

Before you start, you should ensure that you have obtained or built the necessary Docker images locally. Please clone
the repository and create the necessary images by running the commands shown below. Note that you might need to run some
commands as a privileged user:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Big-Data-Spark.git
cd tutorials.Big-Data-Spark
git checkout NGSI-LD
./services create
```

This command will also import seed data from the previous tutorials and provision the dummy IoT sensors on startup.

To start the system with your preferred [context broker](https://www.fiware.org/catalogue/#components), run the
following command:

```bash
./services [orion|scorpio|stellio]
```

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

## Real-time Processing Operations

According to the [Apache Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/documentation.html), Spark Streaming is an
extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data
streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using
complex algorithms expressed with high-level functions like map, reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be
pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards. In fact, you can apply Spark’s machine learning and graph
processing algorithms on data streams.

![](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/img/streaming-arch.png)

Internally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches,
which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.

![](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/img/streaming-flow.png)

This means that to create a streaming data flow we must supply the following:

-   A mechanism for reading Context data as a **Source Operator**.
-   Business logic to define the transform operations.
-   A mechanism for pushing Context data back to the context broker as a **Sink Operator**.

The **Cosmos Spark** connector - `orion.spark.connector-1.2.2.jar` offers both **Source** and **Sink** operators. It
therefore only remains to write the necessary Scala code to connect the streaming dataflow pipeline operations together.
The processing code can be complied into a JAR file which can be uploaded to the spark cluster. Two examples will be
detailed below, all the source code for this tutorial can be found within the
[cosmos-examples](https://github.com/ging/fiware-cosmos-orion-spark-connector-tutorial/tree/master/cosmos-examples)
directory.

Further Spark processing examples can be found on
[Spark Connector Examples](https://fiware-cosmos-spark-examples.readthedocs.io/).

### Compiling a JAR file for Spark

An existing `pom.xml` file has been created which holds the necessary prerequisites to build the examples JAR file.

In order to use the Orion Spark Connector we first need to manually install the connector JAR as an artifact using
Maven:

```bash
cd cosmos-examples
curl -LO https://github.com/ging/fiware-cosmos-orion-spark-connector/releases/download/FIWARE_7.9.1/orion.spark.connector-1.2.2.jar
mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=./orion.spark.connector-1.2.2.jar \
  -DgroupId=org.fiware.cosmos \
  -DartifactId=orion.spark.connector \
  -Dversion=1.2.2 \
  -Dpackaging=jar
```

Thereafter, the source code can be compiled by running the `mvn package` command within the same directory
(`cosmos-examples`):

```bash
mvn package
```

A new JAR file called `cosmos-examples-1.2.2.jar` will be created within the `cosmos-examples/target` directory.

### Generating a stream of Context Data

For the purpose of this tutorial, we must be monitoring a system in which the context is periodically being updated. The
dummy IoT Sensors can be used to do this. Open the device monitor page at `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor` and
start a tractor moving. This can be done by selecting an appropriate the command from the drop-down list and pressing
the `send` button. The stream of measurements coming from the devices can then be seen on the same page:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Big-Data-Spark/img/farm-devices.gif)

## Logger - Reading Context Data Streams

The first example makes use of the `OrionReceiver` operator in order to receive notifications from the Orion Context
Broker. Specifically, the example counts the number notifications that each type of device sends in one minute. You can
find the source code of the example in
[org/fiware/cosmos/tutorial/Logger.scala](https://github.com/ging/fiware-cosmos-orion-spark-connector-tutorial/blob/master/cosmos-examples/src/main/scala/org/fiware/cosmos/tutorial/Logger.scala).

### Logger - Installing the JAR

Restart the containers if necessary, then access the worker container:

```bash
docker exec -it spark-worker-1 bin/bash
```

And run the following command to run the generated JAR package in the Spark cluster:

```bash
/spark/bin/spark-submit \
--class  org.fiware.cosmos.tutorial.LoggerLD \
--master  spark://spark-master:7077 \
--deploy-mode client /home/cosmos-examples/target/cosmos-examples-1.2.2.jar \
--conf "spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Dlog4jspark.root.logger=WARN,console"
```

### Logger - Subscribing to context changes

Once a dynamic context system is up and running (we have deployed the `Logger` job in the Spark cluster), we need to
inform **Spark** of changes in context.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions` endpoint of the Orion Context Broker:

-   The `NGSILD-Tenant` header is used to filter the subscription to only listen to measurements from the attached IoT
    Sensors, since they had been provisioned using these settings.

-   The notification `uri` must match the one our Spark program is listening to.

-   The `throttling` value defines the rate that changes are sampled.

Open another terminal and run the following command:

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot' \
--data-raw '{
  "description": "Notify Spark of all animal and farm vehicle movements",
  "type": "Subscription",
  "entities": [{"type": "Tractor"}, {"type": "Device"}],
  "watchedAttributes": ["location"],
  "notification": {
    "attributes": ["location"],
    "format": "normalized",
    "endpoint": {
      "uri": "http://spark-worker-1:9001",
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
  },
   "@context": "http://context/user-context.jsonld"
}'
```

The response will be **`201 - Created`**.

If a subscription has been created, we can check to see if it is firing by making a GET request to the
`/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/` endpoint.

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot'
```

#### Response:

> **Tip:** Use [jq](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-transform-json-data-with-jq) to format the
> JSON responses in this tutorial. Pipe the result by appending

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Subscription:60216f404dae3a1f22b705e6",
        "type": "Subscription",
        "description": "Notify Spark of all animal and farm vehicle movements",
        "entities": [{ "type": "Tractor" }, { "type": "Device" }],
        "watchedAttributes": ["location"],
        "notification": {
            "attributes": ["location"],
            "format": "normalized",
            "endpoint": {
                "uri": "http://spark-worker-1:9001",
                "accept": "application/json"
            },
            "timesSent": 74,
            "lastNotification": "2021-02-08T17:06:06.043Z"
        }
    }
]
```

Within the `notification` section of the response, you can see several additional `attributes` which describe the health
of the subscription.

If the criteria of the subscription have been met, `timesSent` should be greater than `0`. A zero value would indicate
that the `subject` of the subscription is incorrect or the subscription has created with the wrong `fiware-service-path`
or `fiware-service` header.

The `lastNotification` should be a recent timestamp - if this is not the case, then the devices are not regularly
sending data. Remember to activate the smart farm by moving a **Tractor**.

The `lastSuccess` should match the `lastNotification` date - if this is not the case then **Cosmos** is not receiving
the subscription properly. Check that the hostname and port are correct.

Finally, check that the `status` of the subscription is `active` - an expired subscription will not fire.

### Logger - Checking the Output

Leave the subscription running for **one minute**. Then, the output on the console on which you ran the Spark job will
be like the following:

```text
Sensor(Tractor,19)
Sensor(Device,49)
```

### Logger - Analyzing the Code

```java
package org.fiware.cosmos.tutorial
import org.apache.spark._
import org.apache.spark.streaming.{Seconds, StreamingContext}
import org.fiware.cosmos.orion.spark.connector._
/**
  * Logger example NGSILD Connector
  * @author @Javierlj
  */
object LoggerLD{

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("Example 1")
    val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(60))
    // Create Orion Receiver. Receive notifications on port 9001
    val eventStream = ssc.receiverStream(new NGSILDReceiver(9001))

    // Process event stream
    eventStream
      .flatMap(event => event.entities)
      .map(ent => {
        new Sensor(ent.`type`)
      })
      .countByValue()
      .window(Seconds(60))
      .print()


    ssc.start()
    ssc.awaitTermination()
  }
  case class Sensor(device: String)
}
```

The first lines of the program are aimed at importing the necessary dependencies, including the connector. The next step
is to create an instance of the `NGSILDReceiver` using the class provided by the connector and to add it to the
environment provided by Spark.

The `NGSILDReceiver` constructor accepts a port number (`9001`) as a parameter. This port is used to listen to the
subscription notifications coming from Orion and converted to a `DataStream` of `NgsiEvent` objects. The definition of
these objects can be found within the
[Orion-Spark Connector documentation](https://github.com/ging/fiware-cosmos-orion-spark-connector/blob/master/README.md#orionreceiver).

The stream processing consists of five separate steps. The first step (`flatMap()`) is performed in order to put
together the entity objects of all the NGSI Events received in a period of time. Thereafter, the code iterates over them
(with the `map()` operation) and extracts the desired attributes. In this case, we are interested in the sensor `type`
(`Device` or `Tractor`).

Within each iteration, we create a custom object with the property we need: the sensor `type`. For this purpose, we can
define a case class as shown:

```java
case class Sensor(device: String)
```

Thereafter, can count the created objects by the type of device (`countByValue()`) and perform operations such as
`window()` on them.

After the processing, the results are output to the console:

```java
processedDataStream.print()
```

## Feedback Loop - Persisting Context Data

The second example turns on a water faucet when the soil humidity is too low and turns it back off it when the soil
humidity it is back to normal levels. This way, the soil humidity is always kept at an adequate level.

The dataflow stream uses the `NGSILDSource` operator in order to receive notifications and filters the input to only
respond to motion sensors and then uses the `NGSILDSink` to push processed context back to the Context Broker. You can
find the source code of the example in
[org/fiware/cosmos/tutorial/FeedbackLD.scala](https://github.com/ging/fiware-cosmos-orion-spark-connector-tutorial/blob/master/cosmos-examples/src/main/scala/org/fiware/cosmos/tutorial/FeedbackLD.scala).

### Feedback Loop - Installing the JAR

```bash
/spark/bin/spark-submit  \
--class  org.fiware.cosmos.tutorial.FeedbackLD \
--master  spark://spark-master:7077 \
--deploy-mode client /home/cosmos-examples/target/cosmos-examples-1.2.2.jar \
--conf "spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Dlog4jspark.root.logger=WARN,console"
```

### Feedback Loop - Subscribing to context changes

A new subscription needs to be set up to run this example. The subscription is listening to changes of context on the
soil humidity sensor.

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot' \
--data-raw '{
  "description": "Notify Spark of changes of Soil Humidity",
  "type": "Subscription",
  "entities": [{"type": "SoilSensor"}],
  "watchedAttributes": ["humidity"],
  "notification": {
    "attributes": ["humidity"],
    "format": "normalized",
    "endpoint": {
      "uri": "http://spark-worker-1:9001",
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
  },
   "@context": "http://context/user-context.jsonld"
}'
```

If a subscription has been created, we can check to see if it is firing by making a GET request to the
`/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/` endpoint.

#### 4 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot'
```

### Feedback Loop - Checking the Output

Go to `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

Raise the temperature in Farm001 and wait until the humidity value is below 35, then the water faucet will be
automatically turned on to increase the soil humidity. When the humidity rises above 50, the water faucet will be turned
off automatically as well.

### Feedback Loop - Analyzing the Code

```java
package org.fiware.cosmos.tutorial


import org.apache.spark._
import org.apache.spark.streaming.{Seconds, StreamingContext}
import org.fiware.cosmos.orion.spark.connector._

/**
  * FeedbackLD Example Orion Connector

  )
  final val LOW_THRESHOLD = 35
  final val HIGH_THRESHOLD = 50
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("Feedback")
    val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(10))

    // Create Orion Receiver. Receive notifications on port 9001
    val eventStream = ssc.receiverStream(new NGSILDReceiver(9001))

    // Process event stream
    val processedDataStream = eventStream.flatMap(event => event.entities)
      .filter(ent => ent.`type` == "SoilSensor")

    /* High humidity */

    val highHumidity = processedDataStream
      .filter(ent =>  (ent.attrs("humidity") != null) && (ent.attrs("humidity")("value").asInstanceOf[BigInt] > HIGH_THRESHOLD))
      .map(ent => (ent.id,ent.attrs("humidity")("value")))

    val highSinkStream= highHumidity.map(sensor => {
      OrionSinkObject(CONTENT,"http://orion:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:water"+sensor._1.takeRight(3)+"/attrs/off",CONTENT_TYPE,METHOD,HEADERS)
    })

    highHumidity.map(sensor => "Sensor" + sensor._1 + " has detected a humidity level above " + HIGH_THRESHOLD + ". Turning off water faucet!").print()
    OrionSink.addSink( highSinkStream )


    /* Low humidity */
    val lowHumidity = processedDataStream
      .filter(ent => (ent.attrs("humidity") != null) && (ent.attrs("humidity")("value").asInstanceOf[BigInt] < LOW_THRESHOLD))
      .map(ent => (ent.id,ent.attrs("humidity")("value")))

    val lowSinkStream= lowHumidity.map(sensor => {
      OrionSinkObject(CONTENT,"http://orion:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:water"+sensor._1.takeRight(3)+"/attrs/on",CONTENT_TYPE,METHOD,HEADERS)
    })

    lowHumidity.map(sensor => "Sensor" + sensor._1 + " has detected a humidity level below " + LOW_THRESHOLD + ". Turning on water faucet!").print()
    OrionSink.addSink( lowSinkStream )

    ssc.start()
    ssc.awaitTermination()
  }
}
```

As you can see, it is similar to the previous example. The main difference is that it writes the processed data back in
the Context Broker through the **`OrionSink`**.

The arguments of the **`OrionSinkObject`** are:

-   **Message**: `"{\n \"type\" : \"Property\",\n \"value\" : \" \" \n}"`.
-   **URL**: `"http://orion:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:water"+sensor._1.takeRight(3)+"/attrs/on"` or
    `"http://orion:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:water"+sensor._1.takeRight(3)+"/attrs/off"`, depending on
    whether we are turning on or off the water faucet. TakeRight(3) gets the number of the sensor, for example '001'.
-   **Content Type**: `ContentType.JSON`.
-   **HTTP Method**: `HTTPMethod.PATCH`.
-   **Headers**:
    `Map("NGSILD-Tenant" -> "openiot", "Link" -> "<http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context\"; type=\"application/ld+json\"" )`.
    We add the headers we need in the HTTP Request.
