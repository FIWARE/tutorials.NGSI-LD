**Description:** This tutorial a wires up the dummy [JSON](https://json.org/)-based IoT devices using the
[IoT Agent for JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
devices so that measurements can be read and commands can be sent using
[NGSI LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.08.01_60/gs_cim009v010801p.pdf) requests sent to an
NGSI-LD compliant context broker such as the [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as

# Why are multiple IoT Agents needed?

> "Ils en conclurent que la syntaxe est une fantaisie et la grammaire une illusion."
>
> — Gustave Flaubert (Bouvard and Pecuchet)

As defined previously, an IoT Agent is a component that lets a group of devices sends their data to and be managed from
a Context Broker using their own native protocols. Every IoT Agent is defined for a single payload format, although they
may be able to use multiple disparate transports for that payload.

We have already encountered the Ultralight IoT Agent, which communicates using a simple bar (`|`) separated list of
key-value pairs. This payload is a simple, terse but relatively obscure communication mechanism - by far the commonest
messaging payload used on the Internet is the so-called JavaScript Object Notation or JSON which will be familiar to any
software developer.

JSON is slightly more verbose than Ultralight, but the cost of sending larger messages is offset by the familiarity of
the syntax. A separate
[IoT Agent for JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
has been created specifically to cope with messages sent in this format, since a large number of common devices are able
to be programmed to send messages in JSON and many software libraries exist to parse the data.

There is no practical difference between communicating using a JSON payload and communicating using the Ultralight plain
text payload - provided that the basis of that communication - in other words the fundamental protocol defining how the
messages are passed between the components remains the same. Obviously the parsing of JSON payloads within the IoT
Agent - the conversion of messages from JSON to NGSI and vice-versa will be unique to the JSON IoT Agent.

A direct comparison of the two IoT Agents can be seen below:

| IoT Agent for Ultralight                                            | IoT Agent for JSON                                                  | Protocol's Area of Concern |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Sample Measure `c\1`                                                | Sample Measure `{"count": "1"}`                                     | Message Payload            |
| Sample Command `Robot1@turn\left`                                   | Sample Command `{"Robot1": {"turn": "left"}}`                       | Message Payload            |

| Offers 3 transports - HTTP, MQTT and AMPQ                           | Offers 3 transports - HTTP, MQTT and AMPQ                           | Transport Mechanism        |
| HTTP listens for measures on `iot/d` by default                     | HTTP listens for measures on `iot/json` by default                  | Transport Mechanism        |
| HTTP devices are identified by parameters `?i=XXX&k=YYY`            | HTTP devices are identified by parameters `?i=XXX&k=YYY`            | Device Identification      |
| HTTP commands posted to a well-known URL - response is in the reply | HTTP commands posted to a well-known URL - response is in the reply | Communications Handshake   |
| MQTT devices are identified by the path of the topic `/XXX/YYY`     | MQTT devices are identified by the path of the topic `/XXX/YYY`     | Device Identification      |
| MQTT commands posted to the `cmd` topic                             | MQTT commands posted to the `cmd` topic                             | Communications Handshake   |
| MQTT command responses posted to the `cmdexe` topic                 | MQTT commands posted to the `cmdexe` topic                          | Communications Handshake   |

As can be seen, the message payload differs entirely between the two IoT Agents, but much of the rest of the protocol
remains the same.

## Southbound Traffic (Commands)

HTTP requests generated by the Orion Context Broker and passed downwards towards an IoT device (via an IoT agent) are
known as southbound traffic. Southbound traffic consists of **commands** made to actuator devices which alter the state
of the real world by their actions.

For example to switch on a real-life JSON **Irrigation System** the following interactions would occur:

1.  An NGSI-LD PATCH request is sent to the **Context broker** to update the current context of **Irrigation System**

-   this is effectively an indirect request invoke the `on` command of the **Irrigation System**.

2.  The **Context Broker** finds the entity within the context and notes that the context provision for this attribute
    has been delegated to the IoT Agent.
3.  Using the standard forwarding mechanism, the **Context broker** duplicates the PATCH request and forwards it to the
    North Port of the **IoT Agent** to invoke the command.
4.  The **IoT Agent** receives this Southbound request and converts it to JSON syntax and passes it on to the
    **Irrigation System**.
5.  The **Irrigation System** switches on the water sprinkler and returns the result of the command to the **IoT Agent**
    in JSON syntax.
6.  The **IoT Agent** receives this Northbound request, interprets it and passes the result of the interaction into the
    context by making an NGSI-LD request to the **Context Broker**.
7.  The **Context Broker** receives this Northbound request and updates the context with the result of the command.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent-JSON/img/command-swimlane.png)

-   Requests between **User** and **Context Broker** use NGSI-LD.
-   Requests between **Context Broker** and **IoT Agent** use NGSI-LD.
-   Requests between **IoT Agent** and **IoT Device** use native protocols.
-   Requests between **IoT Device** and **IoT Agent** use native protocols.
-   Requests between **IoT Agent** and **Context Broker** use NGSI-LD.

## Northbound Traffic (Measurements)

Requests generated from an IoT device and passed back upwards towards the Context Broker (via an IoT agent) are known as
northbound traffic. Northbound traffic consists of **measurements** made by sensor devices and relays the state of the
real world into the context data of the system.

For example for a real-life **Soil Sensor** to send a humidity reading, the following interactions would occur:

1.  A **Soil Sensor** makes a measurement and passes the result to the **IoT Agent**.
2.  The **IoT Agent** receives this Northbound request, converts the result from JSON syntax and passes the result of
    the interaction into the context by making an NGSI-LD request to the **Context Broker**.
3.  The **Context Broker** receives this Northbound request and updates the context with the result of the measurement.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent-JSON/img/measurement-swimlane.png)

-   Requests between **IoT-Device** and **IoT-Agent** use native protocols.
-   Requests between **IoT-Agent** and **Context-Broker** use NGSI-LD.

> **Note** Other more complex interactions are also possible, but this overview is sufficient to understand the basic
> principles of an IoT Agent.

## Common Functionality

As can be seen from the previous sections, although each IoT Agent will be unique since they interpret different
protocols, there will a large degree of similarity between IoT agents.

-   Offering a standard endpoint to listen to device updates.
-   Offering a standard endpoint to listen to context data updates.
-   Holding a list of devices and mapping context data attributes to device syntax.
-   Security Authorization.

This base functionality has been abstracted out into a common
[IoT Agent framework library](https://iotagent-node-lib.readthedocs.io/).

#### Device Monitor

For the purpose of this tutorial, a series of dummy agricultural IoT devices have been created, which will be attached
to the context broker. Details of the architecture and protocol used can be found in the
[IoT Sensors tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Sensors/tree/NGSI-LD) The state of each device can be
seen on the JSON device monitor web page found at: `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`.

# Architecture

This application builds on the components created in
[previous tutorials](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Subscriptions/). It will make use of two FIWARE components - an
NGSI-LD Context Broker such as [Orion](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the
[IoT Agent for JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Usage of the Context Broker is sufficient
for an application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_. Both the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open
source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep persistence of the information they hold. We will also be
using the dummy IoT devices created in the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Sensors/).

Therefore, the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json).
-   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive
    southbound requests using
    [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json)
    and convert them to
    [JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual) commands
    for the devices.
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database:
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations.
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys.
-   An HTTP **Web-Server** which offers static `@context` files defining the context entities within the system.
-   The **Tutorial Application** does the following:
    -   Acts as set of dummy [agricultural IoT devices](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Sensors/tree/NGSI-LD)
        using the
        [JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        protocol running over HTTP.

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent-JSON/img/architecture-ld.png)

The necessary configuration information for wiring up the IoT devices and the IoT Agent can be seen in the services
section of the associated `docker-compose.yml` file:

<h3>Dummy IoT Devices Configuration</h3>

```yaml
tutorial:
    image: quay.io/fiware/tutorials.ngsi-ld
    hostname: iot-sensors
    container_name: fiware-tutorial
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "3000"
        - "3001"
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
        - "3001:3001"
    environment:
        - "DEBUG=tutorial:*"
        - "PORT=3000"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_HOST=iot-agent"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7896"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT=3001"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_API_KEY=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT=HTTP"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_PAYLOAD=JSON"
        - "IOTA_JSON_LD_CONTEXT=http://context/user-context.jsonld"
```

The `tutorial` container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `3000` is exposed, so we can see the web page displaying the Dummy IoT devices.
-   Port `3001` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make JSON commands without being
    part of the same network.

The `tutorial` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                     | Value                                | Description                                                                                                                         |

The other `tutorial` container configuration values described in the YAML file are not used in this tutorial.

<h3>IoT Agent for JSON Configuration</h3>

The [IoT Agent for JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be instantiated within a Docker
container. An official Docker image is available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/iotagent-json/)
tagged `fiware/iotagent-json`. The necessary configuration can be seen below:

```yaml
iot-agent:
    image: quay.io/fiware/iotagent-json:latest
    hostname: iot-agent
    container_name: fiware-iot-agent
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "4041"
        - "7896"
    ports:
        - "4041:4041"
        - "7896:7896"
    environment:
        - IOTA_CB_HOST=orion
        - IOTA_CB_PORT=1026
        - IOTA_NORTH_PORT=4041
        - IOTA_REGISTRY_TYPE=mongodb
        - IOTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
        - IOTA_TIMESTAMP=true
        - IOTA_CB_NGSI_VERSION=ld
        - IOTA_AUTOCAST=true
        - IOTA_MONGO_HOST=mongo-db
        - IOTA_MONGO_PORT=27017
        - IOTA_MONGO_DB=iotagentjson
        - IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7896
        - IOTA_PROVIDER_URL=http://iot-agent:4041
        - IOTA_DEFAULT_RESOURCE=/iot/json
        - IOTA_JSON_LD_CONTEXT=http://context/user-context.jsonld
        - IOTA_FALLBACK_TENANT=openiot
        - IOTA_MULTI_CORE=true
```

The `iot-agent` container relies on the presence of the Orion Context Broker and uses a MongoDB database to hold device
information such as device URLs and Keys. The container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `7896` is exposed to receive JSON measurements over HTTP from the Dummy IoT devices.
-   Port `4041` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make provisioning commands without
    being part of the same network.

The `iot-agent` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                  | Value                                | Description                                                                                                                                           |

# Start Up

Before you start you should ensure that you have obtained or built the necessary Docker images locally. Please clone the
repository and create the necessary images by running the commands as shown:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Agent-JSON.git
cd tutorials.IoT-Agent-JSON
git checkout NGSI-LD

./services create
```

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Agent-JSON/blob/NGSI-LD/services) Bash script provided within the
repository. To start the system with your preferred [context broker](https://www.fiware.org/catalogue/#components), run
the following command:

```bash
./services [orion|scorpio|stellio]
```

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

# Provisioning an IoT Agent

To follow the tutorial correctly please ensure you have the device monitor page available in your browser and click on
the page to enable audio before you enter any cUrl commands. The device monitor displays the current state of an array
of dummy devices using JSON syntax.

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>

The device monitor can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`.

## Checking the IoT Agent Service Health

You can check if the IoT Agent is running by making an HTTP request to the exposed port:

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/about'
```

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "libVersion": "2.12.0-next",
    "port": "4041",
    "baseRoot": "/",
    "version": "1.13.0-next"
}
```

> **What if I get a `Failed to connect to localhost port 4041: Connection refused` Response?**
>
> If you get a `Connection refused` response, the IoT Agent cannot be found where expected for this tutorial - you will
> need to substitute the URL and port in each cUrl command with the corrected IP address. All the cUrl commands tutorial
> assume that the IoT Agent is available on `localhost:4041`.
>
> Try the following remedies:
>
> -   To check that the docker containers are running try the following:
>
> ```
> docker ps
> ```
>
> You should see four containers running. If the IoT Agent is not running, you can restart the containers as necessary.
> This command will also display open port information.
>
> -   If you have installed [`docker-machine`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) and

>
> ```
> curl -X GET \
>  'http://$(docker-machine ip default):4041/version'
> ```
>
> Alternatively run all your curl commands from within the container network:
>
> ```
> docker run --network fiware_default --rm appropriate/curl -s \
>  -X GET 'http://iot-agent:4041/iot/about'
> ```

## Connecting IoT Devices

The IoT Agent acts as a middleware between the IoT devices and the context broker. It therefore needs to be able to
create context data entities with unique IDs. Once a service has been provisioned and an unknown device makes a
measurement the IoT Agent add this to the context using the standard `urn:ngsi-ld:` prefix, a default `type` and the
supplied `<device-id>` (unless the device is recognized and can be mapped to a known ID).

In the case of **NGSI-LD**, the definition of every attributes of each device entity should be made available in the
supplied `@context` file. The base **Device** Smart Data Model can be found
[here](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/swagger/device.yaml). To allow for
this discoverability and interoperability with third party systems, the IoT Agent must also be pre-supplied with a
`IOTA_JSON_LD_CONTEXT` environment variable which hold the location of the `@context` file that is resent to the context
broker with every request.

There is no guarantee that every supplied IoT device `<device-id>` will always be unique, therefore all provisioning
requests to the IoT Agent require two mandatory headers:

-   `fiware-service` header (equivalent to `NGSILD-Tenant`) is defined so that entities for a given service can be held
    in a separate mongoDB database.
-   `fiware-servicepath` can be used to differentiate between arrays of devices.

Note that the **NGSI-LD** IoT Agents are backwardly compatible with **NGSI-v2** and therefore currently still use the
names of the older FIWARE headers for when provisioning.

For example within a smart city application you would expect different `fiware-service` headers for different
departments (e.g. parks, transport, refuse collection etc.) and each `fiware-servicepath` would refer to specific park
and so on. This would mean that data and devices for each service can be identified and separated as needed, but the
data would not be siloed - for example data from a **Smart Bin** within a park can be combined with the **GPS Unit** of
a refuse truck to alter the route of the truck in an efficient manner.

The **Smart Bin** and **GPS Unit** are likely to come from different manufacturers and it cannot be guaranteed that
there is no overlap within `<device-id>`s used. The use of the `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers can
ensure that this is always the case, and allows the context broker to identify the original source of the context data.

### Provisioning a Service Group

Invoking group provision is always the first step in connecting devices since it is always necessary to supply an
authentication key with each measurement and the IoT Agent will not initially know which URL the context broker is
responding on.

It is also possible to set up default commands and attributes for all anonymous devices as well, but this is not done
within this tutorial as we will be provisioning each device separately.

This example provisions an anonymous group of devices. It tells the IoT Agent that a series of devices will be sending
messages to the `IOTA_HTTP_PORT` (where the IoT Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications).

#### 2 Request:

-H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
-H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "services": [
        {
            "apikey": "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
            "cbroker": "http://orion:1026",
            "entity_type": "Device",
            "resource": "/iot/json",
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "object_id": "bpm", "type": "Property", "name": "heartRate",
                    "metadata": { "unitCode": {"type": "Text", "value": "5K" }}
                },
                {
                    "object_id": "s", "name": "status", "type": "Property"
                },
                {
                    "object_id": "gps", "name": "location", "type": "geo:point"
                }
            ],
            "static_attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "category", "type": "Property", "value": "sensor"
                },
                {
                    "name": "supportedProtocol", "type": "Property", "value": "ul20"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}'
```

In the example the IoT Agent is informed that the `/iot/json` endpoint will be used and that devices will authenticate
themselves by including the token `4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov`. For an UltraLight IoT Agent this means devices will be
sending GET or POST requests to:

```text
http://iot-agent:7896/iot/json?i=<device_id>&k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov
```

Which should be familiar syntax from the [previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md).

The service group provisioning can also be used to define `attributes` mappings and common `static_attributes`. The
`attributes` mappings define common aliases for anonymous incoming devices. For example the key `gps` can be defined to
map the `location` GeoProperty.

When a measurement from an IoT device is received on the resource URL it needs to be interpreted and passed to the
context broker. The `entity_type` attribute provides a default `type` for each device which has made a request, in this
case anonymous devices will be known as `Device` entities. Furthermore, the location of the context broker (`cbroker`)
is needed, so that the IoT Agent can pass on any measurements received to the correct location. `cbroker` is an optional
attribute - if it is not provided, the IoT Agent uses the context broker URL as defined in the configuration file,
however it has been included here for completeness.

### Provisioning a Sensor

The NGSI-LD [specification](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.08.01_60/gs_cim009v010801p.pdf)
mandates full URNs when creating context data entities, however the incoming messages from the devices will not be aware
of this convention. Furthermore, the attribute name on the context data entity should match the short names found within
the associated `@context` file. These mappings can be defined at the service group level as seen in the previous
request, or they can be defined by provisioning each device individually.

Three types of measurement attributes can be provisioned:

-   `attributes` are mappings of the active readings from the device.
-   `lazy` attributes are only sent on request - The IoT Agent will inform the device to return the measurement.
-   `static_attributes` are as the name suggests static data about the device (such as relationships) passed on to the
    context broker.

> **Note**: in the case where individual `id`s are not required, or aggregated data is sufficient the `attributes` can
> be defined within the provisioning service rather than individually.

          "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn001"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

In the request we are associating the device `temperature001` with the URN `urn:ngsi-ld:Device:temperature001` and
mapping the device reading `t` with the context attribute `temperature` (which is defined as **Property** with
appropriate meta-data). A `controlledAsset` **Relationship** is also defined as a `static_attribute`, placing the device
within the **Building** `urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn001`.

You can simulate a dummy IoT device measurement coming from the **Temperature Sensor** device `temperature001`, by
making the following request.

#### 4 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:7896/iot/json?k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov&i=temperature001' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{ "t": 3}'
```

A similar request was made in the previous tutorial (before the IoT Agent was connected) when the sprinkler system was
activated, you will have seen the state of each sensor changing and a Northbound request will be logged in the device
monitor.

In this tutorial, now that the IoT Agent is connected, the service group has defined the endpoint upon which the IoT
Agent is listening (`/iot/json`) and the API key used to authenticate the request (`4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov`). Since
both of these are recognized from the request, the measurement is valid.

Because we have specifically provisioned the device (`temperature001`) - the IoT Agent is able to map attributes before
raising a request with the Orion Context Broker.

You can see that a measurement has been recorded, by retrieving the entity data from the context broker. Don't forget to
add the `fiware-service` and `fiware-service-path` headers.

#### 5 Request:

```bash
curl -G -iX GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:temperature001' \
    -H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot' \
    -H 'NGSILD-Path: /' \
    -H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
    -H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
    -d 'attrs=temperature'
```

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "http://context/user-context.jsonld",
        "https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.7.jsonld"
    ],

        "type": "Property",
        "value": 3,
        "unitCode": "CEL",
        "observedAt": "2020-09-14T15:23:12.263Z"
    }
}
```

The response shows that the **Temperature Sensor** device with `id=temperature001` has been successfully identified by
the IoT Agent and mapped to the entity `id=urn:ngsi-ld:Device:temperature001`. This new entity has been created within
the context data. The `t` attribute from the dummy device measurement request has been mapped to the more meaningful
`temperature` attribute within the context. As you will notice, an `observedAt` attribute has been added to the metadata
of the attribute - this represents the last time the entity and attribute have been updated, and is automatically added
to each new entity because the `IOTA_TIMESTAMP` environment variable was set when the IoT Agent was started up.

By provisioning the service group, it is also possible to open the IoT Agent to receive readings from anonymous devices.
For example, it would be unnecessary to provision each individual device if all necessary data is available direct from
the device itself.

For example, consider this request to the `/iot/json` endpoint:

#### 6 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST 'http://localhost:7896/iot/json?k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov&i=motion003' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"c": 1}'
```

Because the resource endpoint has previously been defined within the service group and the API Key matches, this is
recognised as a valid measure and therefore a new Entity is created in the context broker with attributes mapped to
based on the knowledge of the service group.

#### 7 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/?type=Device' \
-H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot' \
-H 'NGSILD-Path: /' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"'
```

#### Response:

```json
[
    {
        "@context": [
            "http://context/user-context.jsonld",
            "https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.7.jsonld"
        ],
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:motion003",
        "type": "Device",
        "c": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": 1,
            "observedAt": "2020-09-17T09:41:56.755Z"
        },
        "category": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": "sensor",
            "observedAt": "2020-09-17T09:41:56.755Z"
        },
        "supportedProtocol": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": "ul20",
            "observedAt": "2020-09-17T09:41:56.755Z"
        }
    }
]
```

As you can see, the Entity type and `static_attributes` from the service group have been copied over to the entity in
the context broker, however since the measure `{"c": 1}` does not have a mapping, the name of the Property has been
copied directly from the received measure.

### Provisioning an Actuator

Provisioning an actuator is similar to provisioning a sensor. This time an `endpoint` attribute holds the location where
the IoT Agent needs to send the UltraLight command and the `commands` array includes a list of each command that can be
invoked. The example below provisions water with the `deviceId=water001`. The endpoint is
`http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/water001` and it can accept the `on` command. The `transport=HTTP` attribute defines the
communications protocol to be used.

#### 8 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
    -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
    -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "water001",

      "entity_type": "Device",
      "apikey": "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/water001",
      "commands": [
        {
          "name": "on",
          "type": "Property"
        },
        {
          "name": "off",
          "type": "Property"
        }
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"controlledAsset", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn001"}
        ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

Before we wire-up the context broker, we can test that a command can be sent to a device by making a PATCH request
directly to the IoT Agent's North Port using the `/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/` endpoint. It is this endpoint that will
eventually be invoked by the context broker once we have connected it up. To test the configuration you can run the
command directly as shown:

#### 9 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH 'http://localhost:4041/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:water001/attrs/on' \
    -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
    -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{

        "type": "Property",
        "value": " "

}'
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the water sprinkler change.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent-JSON/img/water-on.png)

The result of the command to turn on the irrigation system can be read by querying the entity within the Context Broker.

#### 10 Request:

            "@value": " on OK"
        },
        "observedAt": "2020-09-14T15:27:11.066Z"
    },
    "controlledAsset": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "object": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn001",
        "observedAt": "2020-09-14T15:27:11.066Z"
    }
}
```

The `observedAt` shows last the time any command associated with the entity has been invoked. The result of `on` command
can be seen in the value of the `on_info` attribute.

### Provisioning a Filling Station

Provisioning a device which offers both commands and measurements is merely a matter of making an HTTP POST request with
both `attributes` and `command` attributes in the body of the request.

#### 11 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
-H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
-H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "filling001",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:filling001",
      "entity_type": "FillingLevelSensor",
      "apikey": "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/filling001",
      "commands": [
        {
          "name": "add",
          "type": "Property"
        },
        {
          "name": "remove",
          "type": "Property"
        }
      ],
      "attributes": [

          "metadata": {
            "unitCode": {
              "type": "Text",
              "value": "C62"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
       "static_attributes": [
        {
          "name": "controlledAsset",
          "type": "Relationship",
          "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn001"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Provisioning a Tractor FMIS System

Similarly, a **Tractor** with two commands (`start` and `stop`) and two attributes can be provisioned as follows:

#### 12 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
    -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
    -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "tractor001",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Device:tractor001",
      "entity_type": "Tractor",
      "apikey": "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/tractor001",
      "commands": [
        {"name": "start","type": "Property"},
        {"name": "stop","type": "Property"}
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"controlledAsset", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn001"}
        ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

The measures from the Tractor (e.g. `gps`) have already been defined within the service group and do not need to be
repeated here.

The full list of provisioned devices can be obtained by making a GET request to the `/iot/devices` endpoint.

#### 13 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
    -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
    -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

## Enabling Context Broker Commands

Having connected up the IoT Agent to the IoT devices, the Orion Context Broker was informed that the commands now are
available. In other words the IoT Agent registered itself as a
[Context Provider](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Context-Providers/) for the command attributes.

Once the commands have been registered it will be possible to turn on the **water**, open and close the **Smart Door**
and switch the **Irrigation System** on and off by sending requests to the Orion Context Broker, rather than sending
JSON requests directly the IoT devices as we did in the [previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md).

### Activating the Irrigation System

To invoke the `on` command, the `on` attribute must be updated in the context.

#### 14 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:water001/attrs/on' \
-H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
--data-raw '{

        "type": "Property",
        "value": " "

}'
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the water change.

### Activating the Tractor

To invoke the `start` command, the `start` attribute must be updated in the context.

#### 15 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:tractor001/attrs/start' \
    -H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
--data-raw '{

        "type": "Property",
        "value": " "

}'
```

### Activating the Filling Station

Change the state of the **Filling System**, the `add` attribute must be updated in the context.

#### 16 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X PATCH 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Device:filling001/attrs/add' \
    -H 'NGSILD-Tenant: openiot' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
--data-raw '{

        "type": "Property",
        "value": " "

}'
```

# Service Group CRUD Actions

The **CRUD** operations for provisioning a service group map on to the expected HTTP verbs under the `/iot/services`
endpoint:

-   **Create** - HTTP POST.
-   **Read** - HTTP GET.
-   **Update** - HTTP PUT.
-   **Delete** - HTTP DELETE.

Use the `resource` and `apikey` parameters to uniquely identify a service group.

### Creating a Service Group

This example provisions an anonymous group of devices. It tells the IoT Agent that a series of devices will be sending
messages to the `IOTA_HTTP_PORT` (where the IoT Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications).

#### 17 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "services": [
   {
     "apikey":      "12345",
     "cbroker":     "http://orion:1026",
     "entity_type": "Thing",
     "resource":    "/iot/json"
   }
 ]
}'
```

### Read Service Group Details

This example obtains the full details of a provisioned service with a given `resource` path.

Service group details can be read by making a GET request to the `/iot/services` endpoint and providing a `resource`
parameter.

#### 18 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services?resource=/iot/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The response includes all the defaults associated with each service group such as the `entity_type` and any default
commands or attribute mappings.

### List all Service Groups

This example lists all provisioned services by making a GET request to the `/iot/services` endpoint.

#### 19 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

                    "type": "Property"
                },
                {
                    "object_id": "gps",
                    "name": "location",
                    "type": "geo:point"
                }
            ],
            "_id": "5f5f8ad8eed02a000687dec5",
            "resource": "/iot/json",
            "apikey": "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
            "service": "openiot",
            "subservice": "/",
            "__v": 0,
            "static_attributes": [],
            "internal_attributes": [],
            "entity_type": "Device"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The response includes all the defaults associated with each service group such as the `entity_type` and any default
commands or attribute mappings.

### Update a Service Group

This example updates an existing service group with a given `resource` path and `apikey`.

Service group details can be updated by making a PUT request to the `/iot/services` endpoint and providing a `resource`
and `apikey` parameters.

#### 20 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PUT \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services?resource=/iot/json&apikey=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "attributes": []
}'
```

### Delete a Service Group

This example removes a provisioned service group by making a DELETE request to the `/iot/services/` endpoint.

It means that requests to `http://iot-agent:7896/iot/json?i=<device_id>&k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov` (where the IoT
Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications) should no longer be processed by the IoT Agent. The `apiKey` and
`resource` parameters must be supplied in order to identify the service group to be deleted.

#### 21 Request:

```bash
curl -iX DELETE \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services/?resource=/iot/json&apikey=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

# Device CRUD Actions

The **CRUD** operations for provisioning individual devices map on to the expected HTTP verbs under the `/iot/devices`
endpoint:

-   **Create** - HTTP POST.
-   **Read** - HTTP GET.
-   **Update** - HTTP PUT.
-   **Delete** - HTTP DELETE.

Use the `<device-id>` to uniquely identify a device.

### Creating a Provisioned Device

This example provisions an individual device. It maps the `device_id=water002` to the entity URN `urn:ngsi-ld:water:002`
and gives the entity a type `water`. The IoT Agent has been informed that the device offers two commands (`on` and
`off`) and is listening on `http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/water002` using HTTP. `attributes`, `lazy` attributes and
`static_attributes` can also be provisioned.

#### 22 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST 'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
    -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
    -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

  "entity_type": "IoT-Device"
}'
```

### Delete a Provisioned Device

This example removes a provisioned device by making a DELETE request to the `/iot/devices/<device-id>` endpoint.

The device attributes will no longer be mapped and commands can no longer be sent to the device. If the device is making
active measurements, they will still be handled with default values if the associated service has not been deleted.

#### 26 Request:

```bash
curl -iX DELETE \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/water002' \
