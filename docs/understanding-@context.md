**Description** This tutorial introduces basics of common Linked Data concepts and Data Models for **NGSI-LD**
developers. The aim is to design and create a simple interoperable Smart Agricultural Solution from scratch and explain
how to apply these concepts to your own smart solutions.

Unlike the previous [tutorials series](http://fiware-tutorials.rtfd.io/), this series will take an **NGSI-LD** first
approach and therefore starts with reiterating the fundamentals of Linked Data and its application to the **NGSI-LD**
interface.

The tutorial is mainly concerned with online and command-line tooling.

# Understanding `@context`

> “Wisdom is intelligence in context.”
>
> ― Raheel Farooq, Kalam

Creating an interoperable system of readable links for computers requires the use of a well-defined data format
([JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/)) and assignation of unique IDs
([URLs or URNs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4913343/what-is-the-difference-between-uri-url-and-urn)) for both
data entities and the relationships between entities so that semantic meaning can be programmatically retrieved from the
data itself. Furthermore, the use and creation of these unique IDs should, as far as possible, be passed around so as
not get in the way of the processing the data objects themselves.

An attempt to solve this interoperability problem has been made within the JSON domain, and this has been done by adding
an `@context` element to existing JSON data structures. This has led to the creation of the **JSON-LD** standard.

The main takeaway from **JSON-LD**, is that a remote context file and the **JSON-LD**
[`@context` definition](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#the-context) can be used to assign unique long URIs for
every defined attribute. Developers are then free to use their own regular short attribute names within their own
applications, converting from URIs to preferred shortnames though the application of Expansion and Compaction
operations.

**NGSI-LD** is a formally structured _extended subset_ of **JSON-LD**. To promote interoperability, the **NGSI-LD** API
is defined using the **JSON-LD** specification and therefore a thorough knowledge of **JSON-LD** and in particular
`@context` files is fundamental to the use **NGSI-LD**.

## What is JSON-LD?

**JSON-LD** is an extension of JSON , it is a standard way of avoiding ambiguity when expressing linked data in JSON so
that the data is structured in a format which is parsable by machines. It is a method of ensuring that all data
attributes can be easily compared when coming from a multitude of separate data sources, which could have a different
idea as to what each attribute means. For example, when two data entities have a `name` attribute how can the computer
be certain that is refers to a _"Name of a thing"_ in the same sense (rather than a **Username** or a **Surname** or
something). URIs and data models are used to remove ambiguity by allowing attributes to have a both short form (such as
`name`) and a fully specified long form (such `http://schema.org/name`) which means it is easy to discover which
attribute have a common meaning within a data structure.

JSON-LD introduces the concept of the `@context` element which provides additional information allowing the computer to
interpret the rest of the data with more clarity and depth.

Furthermore the JSON-LD specification enables you to define a unique `@type` associating a well-defined
[data model](https://fiware-datamodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guidelines/index.html) to the data itself.

## Creating NGSI-LD Data Models

Within the FIWARE platform, every entity represents the state of a physical or conceptual object. Each entity provides
the digital twin of an object which exists in the real world.

Although each data entity within your context will vary according to your use case, the common structure within each
data entity should be standardized order to promote reuse. The Fundamentals for FIWARE Data Model design do not change.
Typically, each entity will consist of an `id`, a `type`, a series of **Property** attributes representing context data
which changes over time and a series of **Relationship** attributes which represent connections between existing
entities.

It is perhaps best to illustrate this using an example. The Underlying Data Models can be created using many tools,
however this example will use Swagger [schema](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/) objects defined using
the [Open API 3](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) Standard. The examples are valid Swagger specifications,
but in reality, we are not interested in defining in paths and operations, as these are already defined using the
[NGSI-LD API](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/swagger/ngsi-ld.yaml)

<h4>The Scenario</h4>

Consider the following Smart Agricultural Scenario:

> _Imagine a farmer owns a barn. The barn contains two IoT devices - a temperature sensor and a filling level sensor
> indicating how much hay is currently stored in the barn_

This example can be split down into the following Entities:

-   **Building**: The barn
-   **Person**: The farmer
-   **IoT Devices**:
    -   Temperature Senor
    -   Filling Level Sensor

## Baseline Data Models

<!-- textlint-disable write-good -->

When architecting your Smart System, it is unnecessary to start from scratch, so the first step is to check to see if
there are any existing NGSI-LD data models which are capable of describing your system. As it happens, there are
existing [Smart Data Models](https://www.fiware.org/developers/smart-data-models/) for both **Building** and **Device**,
so it is possible to check if these will fulfill our needs:

<!-- textlint-enable write-good -->

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Understanding-At-Context/img/swagger.png)

-   The **Building** Data Model can be inspected
    [here](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/swagger/building.yaml)
-   The **Device** Data Model can be inspected
    [here](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/swagger/device.yaml)

Many common concepts such as **Person** or **Product** have been formalized by [Schema.org](https://schema.org/), which
is a collaborative community activity for promoting schemas for structured data on the Internet. The schema.org
[Person](https://schema.org/Person) can be described using a JSON-LD schema, and may be co-opted as an NGSI-LD data
model.

-   The **Person** Data Model can be inspected
    [here](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/swagger/person.yaml)

It should be noted that definitions of the models examined so far are very general and will need further modifications
to be of use in a working system, however using these models as the basis of interoperability will ensure that the
resulting `@context` file will be understandable to the widest number of systems.

> **Note:** The Data Models used here for `@context` generation are defined using OpenAPI 3.0
> [Swagger format](https://swagger.io/specification). To help with the generation of IRIs the specification has been
> extended with additional annotations as necessary. The `x-ngsi` attribute, as the name suggests is just a simple
> [Specification Extension](https://swagger.io/specification/#specificationExtensions) - usually it is not relevant to
> Swagger, and indeed you could generate a simple `@context` file without it, but the data held within in has been used
> to help generate a rich [`@graph`](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#dfn-graph-object) and more comprehensive
> documentation.

> **Caution:** The simple NGSI-LD `@context` generator in the tutorial defaults to using `uri.fiware.org` namespaces and
> updates with corrected URIs based on the `x-ngsi.uri` and `x-ngsi.uri-prefix` attributes. The code and defaults found
> within this tutorial should be altered to a more widely recognised standard ontology provider within your domain as
> necessary for your use case.
>
> For more complex scenarios, additional `@context` generation tools can be found on the
> [Smart Data Models](https://smartdatamodels.org/) website.

## Amending Models

The base data models are useful as a starting point but some enumerated values or attributes will be redundant other
required fields will be missing. The base models will therefore need to be modified to create proper digital twins
specific to the scenario we are modelling

### Removing Redundant Items

Many attributes within data models are optional, and not all options will be valid for our scenario. Take for example,
the `category` attribute within the **Building** model - this offers over 60 types of building useful in multiple
domains such as Smart Cities and Smart Agriculture, it is therefore safe to exclude certain options from our own
`@context` file since they are unlikely to be used. For example a **Building** categorised as `cathedral` is unlikely to
be found on a farm.

It is logical to remove bloat before committing to using a particular model as it will help reduce the size of payloads
used.

### Extending

Looking at the **Building** model, it is obvious that we will need a **Building** entity of `category="barn"`, however
the base **Building** model does not offer additional attributes such as `temperature` or `fillingLevel` - these would
need to be added to the base **Building** so that the context broker is able to hold the _context_ - i.e. the current
state of the building.

Many types of device reading (i.e. context data attributes) have been predefined within the
[SAREF ontology](https://ontology.tno.nl/saref/) - so it is reasonable to use the URIs defining these attributes as a
basis of extending our model.

-   `temperature` (`https://w3id.org/saref#temperature`)
-   `fillingLevel` (`https://w3id.org/saref#fillingLevel`)

Many measurement attributes are defined within the [SAREF](https://ontology.tno.nl/saref/) ontology, but other
ontologies could equally be used. For example, the
[iotschema.org schema](https://github.com/iot-schema-collab/iotschema/blob/master/capability.jsonld) contains equivalent
term URIs like `http://iotschema.org/temperature` which could also be used here, the additional data can be added to the
`@graph` to show the equivalence of the two using Simple Knowledge Organization System terms
[SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#).

### Adding metadata

The key goal in designing NGSI-LD data models (as opposed to a generic hierarchy of ontologies), is that wherever
possible, every _Property_ attribute of a model represents the context data for a digital twin of something tangible in
the real world.

This formulation discourages deep nested hierarchies. A **Building** has a **temperature**, a **Building** has a
**fillingLevel** - anything else is defined as a _Relationship_ - a **Building** has an **owner** which links the
**Building** entity to a separate **Person** entity.

However, just holding the values of properties is insufficient. Saying that `temperature=6` is meaningless unless you
also obtain certain metadata, such as _When was the reading taken?_ _Which device made the reading?_ _What units are it
measured in?_ _How accurate is the device?_ and so on.

Therefore, supplementary metadata items will be necessary to ensure that the context data is understandable. This will
mean we will need things such as:

-   The Units of measurement
-   Which sensor provided the measurement
-   When was the measurement taken
-   and so on.

```json
[
    {
        "temperature": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": 30,
            "unitCode": "CEL",
            "providedBy": "urn:ngsi-ld:TemperatureSensor:001",
            "observedAt": "2016-03-15T11:00:00.000"
        }
    },
    {
        "fillingLevel": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": 0.5,
            "unitCode": "P1",
            "providedBy": "urn:ngsi-ld:FillingLevelSensor:001",
            "observedAt": "2016-03-15T11:00:00.000"
        }
    }
]
```

Each one of these attributes has a name, and therefore requires a definition within the `@context`. Fortunately most of
these are predefined in the core NGSI-LD specification:

-   `unitCode` is specified from a common list such as the UN/CEFACT
    [List of measurement codes](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/recommendations/rec20/rec20_rev3_Annex3e.pdf)
-   `observedAt` is a DateTime a well-defined temporal property expressed in UTC, using the ISO 8601 format.
-   `providedBy` is an example recommendation within the NGSI-LD specification.

### Subclassing

As well as extending models by adding new attributes, it is also possible to extend models by subclassing. Looking at
the **Device** model, it can be seen that whereas common definitions useful to all IoT device such as `batteryLevel` are
defined in the model, there are no additional attributes within the model explaining which readings are being made.

It would be possible to continue to use the **Device** model and to add both `temperature` and `fillingLevel`, but it is
highly unlikely that a filling sensor would also provide temperatures and vice-versa. In this case, it is therefore
preferred to create a new subclass so that temperature sensors can be considered a different type of entity to filling
sensors.

## Using Swagger to extend the Baseline data models

### Initial Baseline data models

The following models are defined within the Smart Data Models domain.

```yaml
components:
    schemas:
        # This is the base definition of a building
        Building:
            $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/building.yaml#/Building"
        # This is all of the defined building categories
        # within the Smart Cities and Smart AgriFood domain
        BuildingCategory:
            $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/building.yaml#/Categories"

        # This is a base definition of an IoT Device
        Device:
            $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/device.yaml#/Device"
        # This is the full list of IoT Device Categories
        DeviceCategory:
            $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/Categories"
        # This is a full list of context attributes measurable by devices
        ControlledProperties:
            $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/ControlledProperties"

        # This is an NGSI-LD definition of a person.
        # Since the schema.org Person is JSON-LD,
        # additional type and id attreibutes are require
        Person:
            allOf:
                - $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/ngsi-ld.yaml#/Common"
                - $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/schema.org.yaml#/Person"
```

The baseline Data Model can be inspected
[here](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Understanding-At-Context/master/baseline.yaml).

The source file for the Baseline Date Models, `baseline.yaml` can be found
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Understanding-At-Context/master/baseline.yaml).

### Updated Data models

1.  **Building** must be updated to accommodate `temperature` and `fillingLevel`. Both of these properties have been
    defined within SAREF terms.

```yaml
Building:
    allOf:
        - $ref: "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/building.yaml#/Building"

    properties:
        temperature:
            $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/temperature
        fillingLevel:
            $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/fillingLevel
```

2.  The list of defined building categories can be reduced to items found within the Agricultural domain (e.g. `barn`,
    `cowshed`, `farm`, `farm_auxiliary`, `greenhouse`, `riding_hall`, `shed`, `stable`, `sty`, `water_tower`)

3.  The base Device can be removed and replaced with two new models which extend it - `TemperatureSensor` and
    `FillingLevelSensor`. Once again these add additional SAREF terms to the base `Device` class.

```yaml
TemperatureSensor:
    type: object
    required:
        - temperature
    allOf:
        - $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/device.yaml#/Device
    properties:
        temperature:
            $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/temperature
```

```yaml
FillingLevelSensor:
    type: object
    required:
        - FillingLevelSensor
    allOf:
        - $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/device.yaml#/Device
    properties:
        fillingLevel:
            $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/fillingLevel
```

4.  The list of controlled attributes can be reduced to those measured by Agricultural devices (e.g `depth`,
    `eatingActivity`, `humidity`, `location`, `milking`, `motion`, `movementActivity`, `occupancy`, `precipitation`,
    `pressure`, `soilMoisture`, `solarRadiation`, `temperature`, `waterConsumption`, `weatherConditions`, `weight`,
    `windDirection`, `windSpeed`)

5.  The other definitions remain unchanged.

The updated Data Models for an Agricultural Smart System can be inspected

## Auto generating `@Context` Files from Swagger

Every working linked data system relies on `@context` files to supply the relevant information about the data. Creating
such files by hand is a tedious and error-prone procedure, so it makes sense to automate the process. The required
structure will depend on the operations involved.

This tutorial will take the Agricultural Smart System data model file `agriculture.yaml` and autogenerate alternatives
for use by other agents.

### Validating a Swagger Data Models

It is necessary to check that the model is valid before processing, this can be done by viewing it online or by using a
simple validator tool.

```bash
./services validate [file]
```

#### Terminal - Result:

```text
The API is valid
```

The underlying file(s) are a valid [Swagger definition](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) which ensures that
the tool can be used to extract attributes and enumerations as necessary.

### Generating an NGSI-LD `@context` file

The NGSI-LD `@context` needs to hold defined URIs for the following:

-   The defined entity `types` within the system
-   The names of all the attributes from within the defined Data Models
-   The names of all the metadata attribute from within the Data Models
-   The enumerated values of any constants used within the Data Models.

An NGSI-LD `@context` file can be generated from a Swagger data model as follows:

```bash
./services ngsi [file]
```

#### Terminal - Result:

```text
Creating a NGSI-LD @context file for normalized interactions
datamodels.context-ngsi.jsonld created
```

Opening the generated file, the following structure can be found:

```json
{
    "@context": {
        "type": "@type",
        "id": "@id",
        "ngsi-ld": "https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/",
        "fiware": "https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels#",
        "schema": "https://schema.org/",
 ...etc
        "Building": "fiware:Building",
        "FillingLevelSensor": "fiware:FillingLevelSensor",
        "Person": "fiware:Person",
        "TemperatureSensor": "fiware:TemperatureSensor",
 ... etc
        "actuator": "https://w3id.org/saref#actuator",
        "additionalName": "schema:additionalName",
        "address": "schema:address",
        "barn": "https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dbarn",
        "batteryLevel": "fiware:batteryLevel",
        "category": "fiware:category",
        "configuration": "fiware:configuration",
        "conservatory": "https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dconservatory",
        "containedInPlace": "fiware:containedInPlace",
        "controlledAsset": "fiware:controlledAsset",
        "controlledProperty": "fiware:controlledProperty",
        "cowshed": "https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dcowshed",
        "depth": "https://w3id.org/saref#depth",
...etc
    }
}
```

The resultant `@context` file is a valid [JSON-LD](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/) Context file usable by NGSI-LD
applications. The file is structured into three parts:

-   A list of standard terms and abbreviations - this avoids the necessity of repeating URIs and reduced the overall
    size of the file
-   A series of defined entity types (e.g. `Building`). These usually start with a capital letter.
-   A list of attributes (e.g. `address`) and enumerations (e.g. `barn`)

Effectively this NGSI-LD `@context` can be combined with a copy of the NGSI-LD core context
[https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.8.jsonld](https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.8.jsonld)
to mechanically define the following:

If a computer encounters an entity of `type=Building` this really refers to a
`https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels#Building`

From the definition of a **Building** we know it has a mandatory `category` and `address`.

If a computer encounters an `address` attribute, this really refers to a `https://schema.org/address` (which in turn has
well-defined sub-attributes)

If a computer encounters a `category=barn` then it should be possible to ensure that this `category` can be identified
as a `https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dbarn`. Note that `category` itself is also well-defined.

NGSI-LD `@context`s are used for all NGSI-LD CRUD operations, and are required when sending or receiving NGSI-LD data in
the default _normalized_ format. The _normalized_ format includes a structure of attributes each with its own `type` and
`value`

For example this is a `Building` in _normalized_ NGSI-LD format:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:001",
    "type": "Building",
    "category": {
        "type": "VocabProperty",
        "vocab": "barn"
    },
    "address": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Großer Stern",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        }
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [13.35, 52.5144]
        }
    },
    "name": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": "Siegessäule Barn"
    },
    "@context": [
        "https://example.com/data-models.context-ngsild.jsonld",
        "https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.8.jsonld"
    ]
}
```

The core context file defines the base structure of the NGSI-LD API payload (things like `type`, `value` and GeoJSON
`Point`) whereas the _generated_ NGSI-LD context for the application itself defines the entities (`Building`) and
`attributes` without defining a payload structure.

### Generating a JSON-LD `@context` file

The JSON-LD `@context` differs from the NGSI-LD `@context` file as it is standalone and does not use the core context
definitions and does not specify metadata attribute definitions such as _properties-of-properties_. It is used in
combination with the simplified NSGI-LD key-values pairs payloads.

The JSON-LD requires the following:

-   The names of all the attributes from within the defined Data Models
-   The enumerated values of any constants used within the Data Models.

Additionally, a JSON-LD `@context` may also include supplementary information (such as _This attribute is an integer_)
and, within the `@graph` definition, information about the relationships between nodes (_This attribute is a link to a
**Person** entity_ ) as well as human-readable information about the attributes themselves (_A barn is an agricultural
building used for storage_) may be returned.

An JSON-LD `@context` file can be generated from a Swagger data model as follows:

```bash
./services jsonld [file]
```

#### Terminal - Result:

```text
Creating a JSON-LD @context file for key-values interactions
datamodels.context.jsonld created
```

Opening the generated file, the following structure can be found:

```json

    "@context": {

                {
                    "@language": "en",
                    "@value": "Property related to some measurements that are characterized by a certain value that is a filling level."
                }
            ],
            "rdfs:label": [
                {
                    "@language": "en",
                    "@value": "fillingLevel"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Once again the resultant `@context` file is a valid [JSON-LD](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/), this time however
it has been designed to be used by any application that understands generic JSON-LD applications. The file is structured
as follows:

-   A list of standard terms and abbreviations - this avoids the necessity of repeating URIs and reduced the overall
    size of the file. For further information read the section on
    [aliasing keywords](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#aliasing-keywords) from the JSON-LD specification.
-   A series of defined entity types (e.g. `Building`). These usually start with a capital letter.
-   A list of attributes - these may be subdivided as follows:
    -   attributes representing context data **Properties** to be displayed as native JSON attributes (e.g.
        `additionalName`), these attributes are annotated to explain the
        [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/) datatype to be used when consuming the data.
    -   attributes representing context data **Properties** which are complex of objects (e.g. `address`), these are
        remain as in the previous example, there is an indication that `address` really refers to a
        `https://schema.org/address` - which in turn has well-defined sub-attributes - and the native types of those
        sub-elements are also defined.
    -   attributes representing context data **Properties** which hold enumerations - e.g. `category` - these hold a
        link indicator in the form of `"@type": "@vocab"`. When these attributes are encountered it indicates that the
        value `category="barn"` can be expanded to the IRI `https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dbarn`
        rather than just as a string holding the short name `barn`. For further information on how this is achieved,
        look at the [shortening IRIs](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#shortening-iris) in the JSON-LD
        specification.
    -   attributes representing context data **Relationships** - e.g. `controlledAsset` - these hold an indicator of a
        link between entities in the form of `"@type": "@id"`. This is the syntax indicating a link, or more formally an
        Internationalized Resource Identifier (see [RFC3987](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#bib-rfc3987)). For
        further information see the [section on IRIs](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#iris) within the JSON-LD
        specification
-   A list of enumerations (e.g. `barn`) - these can be readily expanded by the receiving application when held within
    defined `@vocab` elements.

Furthermore, an additional section in this context file called the `@graph`. This enables the JSON-LD @context to make
additional statements about the graph of linked data itself For example, the generated `@graph` elements are show a
human-readable description of the attribute in English. This could be further expanded to indicate in which entities
each attribute is used, whether an entity definition is a subclass of a base definition (e.g. `TemperatureSensor`
extends `Device`) and so on.

Further information about `@graph` can be found in the section on
[Named Graphs](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#named-graphs).

If NGSI-LD requests are made using the `options=keyValues` parameter, the response a generic JSON-LD object (as shown
below) rather than a full NGSI-LD object:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:001",
    "type": "Building",
    "category": "barn",
    "address": {
        "streetAddress": "Großer Stern",
        "addressRegion": "Berlin",
        "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
        "postalCode": "10557"
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [13.35, 52.5144]
    },
    "name": "Siegessäule Barn",
    "@context": "https://example.com/data-models.context.jsonld"
}
```

This format should be familiar to any user of JSON - the additional `@context` attribute is the mechanism used to
annotate the base JSON payload as JSON-LD linked data.

It should be noted that this JSON-LD payload does not include metadata about attributes - there are no _properties of
properties_ or _relationships of properties_. Therefore, to include a traversable link within JSON-LD it is necessary to
declare it as **Relationship** directly on the entity itself- an example can be found in the `controlledAsset` attribute
of `Device`. Metadata attributes such as the `providedBy` **Relationship** found within the `temperature` **Property**
are only traversable using the NGSI-LD syntax.

### Generating Documentation

The `@context` syntax is designed to be readable by machines. Obviously developers need human-readable documentation
too.

Basic documentation about NGSI-LD entities can be generated from a Swagger data model as follows:

```bash
./services markdown [file]
```

#### Terminal - Result:

```text
Creating Documentation for the Data Models
datamodels.md created
```

The result is a Markdown file holding the documentation for the data models is returned.
